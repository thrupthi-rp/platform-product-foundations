# Platform Product Foundations

This repository captures product thinking around platforms, data, and governance with a focus on long-term product health rather than short-term delivery optics.

It is not a framework library.  
It is a set of working notes and decision lenses reflecting how complex products evolve, decay, and recover over time.

The emphasis is on:
- **Foundational Integrity:** Stability in data and platform architecture.
- **Product Discontinuity:** Navigating the gap between maturity, stagnation, and reinvention.
- **Governance-Awareness:** High-stakes decision-making in regulated environments.
- **Trade-offs:** Balancing speed against long-term resilience and accountability.

## Current Notes

Each note is a working artifact that evolves only when patterns repeat across multiple product contexts.

- **[Decision Boundaries & Reversibility](./Platform_Decision_Boundaries.md)**  
  A working lens for categorizing One-Way vs. Two-Way Doors and enforcing explicit confidence thresholds.

- **[Data Utility & The Editor’s Protocol](./Data_Utility_Protocol.md)**  
  Heuristics for reducing intellectual debt and mapping data collection to explicit decision owners.

- **[The S-Curve & Discontinuity](./s-curve-discontinuity.md)**  
  Exploring why products decay when optimization replaces evolution, and how to spot the discontinuity gap.

## Why this exists

Most product conversations focus on *what to build next*.  
Fewer focus on the reality of the long game:
- When a product has outgrown its original foundations.
- How technical and intellectual debt accumulate quietly behind “green” status reports.
- Why governance decisions shape product outcomes years after the original team and context have moved on.

This repo exists to explore those questions plainly, without presentation polish.

## Status

**Experimental & Practitioner-Led.** New entries are added only when an idea has been exercised in practice and tested against the constraints of complex, regulated systems.
