# platform-product-foundations
Frameworks and decisions models for platform-led product ownership in regulated environments.

## Why this exists
Much of product guidance focuses on feature velocity and growth loops. 

In platform, data, and internal products, the dominant risks are different:
- Irreversible architectural decisions
- Governance and compliance constraints
- Long-term operational and adoption costs
- Hidden complexity accumulating over time

This repository exists to document how I thinkabout those problems especially where product, data, and governance intersect.

## What this is (and is not)
This is:
- A set of lightweight frameworks and lenses
- Focused on decision-making, trade-offs, and long-term product health
- Grounded in real delivery contexts (platforms, data products, regulated systems)

This is not:
- A generic product management playbook
- A feature prioritisation template library
- A collection of opinions optimised for engagement

## Core themes
The work here clusters around a few recussing concerns:
- Platform and API-first products
  Internal platforms, shared capabilities, and ecosystem constraints.

- Data & decision foundations
  Data models, trust, ownership, and downstream impact on product strategy.

- Governance by design
  Risk, compliance, and controls as product inputs - not afterthoughts.

- Lifecycle thinking
  From emergence -> scale -> maturity -> discontinuity, and what breaks in between.

- Decision quality under uncertainty
  Distinguishing reversible vs irreversibe choices, and acting accordingly.

## Frameworks (WIP)
The following artefacts are being developed and refined:
- Decision classification: one-way vs two-way doors
- Product S-curve and discontinuity risk
- Platform governance trade-off mapping
- Adoption vs capability value assessment

## Intended audience
This material is most relevant for:
- Product owners and managers working on platforms, data, or internal products
- Technology and product leaders operating in regulated environments
- Teams navigating scale, legacy, and long-terms accountability

## Status
This repository is intentionally lightweight.
It evolves as ideas are tested in practice, refined through delivery, and pressure-tested against real constraints. 

## Closing note
Clarity compounds. Complexity does not.
