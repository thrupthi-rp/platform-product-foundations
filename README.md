# Platform Product Foundations

This repository captures product thinking around platforms, data, and governance with a focus on long-term product health rather than short-term delivery optics.

It is not a framework library.
It is a set of working notes that reflect how complex products evolve, decay, and recover over time.

The emphasis is on:
- Platform and data foundations
- Product lifecycle and discontinuity
- Governance-aware product decisions
- Trade-offs between speed, resilience, and accountability

These notes are written from practice in regulated, platform-led environments
across energy, public sector, and enterprise data products.

## Current Notes

- **[The S-Curve, Maturity, and Discontinuity](./s-curve-discontinuity.md)**
How products decay in the gap between optimisation and reinvention and why patching often replaces redesign.
- **[Platform Decision Boundaries](./Platform_Decision_Boundaries.md)**
  Decision types and their implications for governance, including Two-Way Door and One-Way Door decisions

## Why this exists

Most product conversations focus on *what to build next*.
Fewer focus on:
- When a product has outgrown its original foundations
- How technical and intellectual debt accumulate quietly
- Why governance decisions shape product outcomes years later

This repo exists to explore those questions plainly, without presentation polish.

## Status

This repository will evolve slowly.
New entries are added only when an idea has been exercised in practice or thought through in depth.
