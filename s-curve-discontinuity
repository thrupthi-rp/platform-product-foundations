# The S-Curve, Maturity, and Discontinuity 

Most products follow a familiar S-Curve:
early experimentation -> rapid growth -> maturity -> plateu. 

What matters isn't the curve itself, but what happens between curves.

The gap between **maturity** and the next discontinuity is where many products begin to decay.

## Where Frankenstein Products are born

When growth plateus, teams face a choice:

- Re-imagine the product's foundations and create a new curve
- Or extend the existing curve through patches, optimisations, and incremental add-ons

Under delivery pressure, most teams choose the second.

This is how Frankenstein Products emerge:
- Legacy architecture stretched beyond their design limits
- "Temporary" fixes that quietly become permanent 
- New capabilities bolted onto data and platform foundations that were never designed to support them

The product continues to ship, but its structural integrity erodes.

## Why teams Patch Instead of Re-design
Patching feels safer than redesigning because:
- It avoids resetting delivery momentum 
- It doesn't require re-justifying sunk costs
- It fits within existing governance and funding models

But patches optimise for short-term continuity at the cost of long-term resilience.

Over time, velocity gives way to fragility.

## Discontinuity Is Not Failure
Discontinuity is often treated as something to avoid.
In practice, it is a signal that the current curve has been fully exploited.

Healthy organisations recognise this moment and:
- Revisit core assumptions
- Re-evaluate data and platform foundations
- Decide deliverately what should evolve, what should endure, and what should be retired

Avoiding discontinuity doesn't preserve value it defers the cost.

## Product Leadership at the Gap
The hardest product decisions are rarely about features.
They are about recognising when optimisation has reached its limit.

The maturity-discontinuity gap is not a delivery problem.
It is a judgement problem.

Teams that fail here don't lack talent or effort; they lack permission to stop patching and start re-imagining.

That's where platform thinking, governance clarity, and lifecycle ownership matter most.
